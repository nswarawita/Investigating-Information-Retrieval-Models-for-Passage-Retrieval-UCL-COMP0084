Instructions to run the code

The Code Folder contains 4 files: 
1) Q1.py
2) Q2_P1.py
3) Q2_P2.py
4) Q3.py



• Q1.py contains the code for subtask 1 - Evaluating Retrieval Quality 

• Q2_P1.py contains the code for subtask 2 - Logistic Regression (LR) until computing query and passage embeddings for both the train and validation data subsets. This may take awhile.

• Q2_P2.py contains the remaining code for subtask 2 - Logistic Regression (LR). This part can be run without running Q2_P1.py as it imports train_df_subset.pkl and validation_df_subset.pkl

• Q3.py contains the code for subtask 3 - LambdaMART model (LM)

• train_df_subset.pkl, validation_df_subset.pkl and relevant_dictionary.pkl are pickled objects. They are required to run the code.
